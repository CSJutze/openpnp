## Bill of materials

Here a list of parts I used in my machine

### Frame construction

The base frame consists mainly out of 20x20 and 40x20 profile elements.
You are free to use different lengths if you want your machine to be bigger or smaller.
I just made them that way so the base frame fits onto an Ikea Lack tabel which measures 550mm x 550mm.

### Frame parts list

- 4 * 550mm 40x20 profile 5
- 6 * 70mm 40x20 profile 5
- 4 * 510mm 20x20 profile 5
