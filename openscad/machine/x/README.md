## X axis

Here you find my OpenSCAD design files in regards to the X-axis setup.

Be aware that the resulting STL files might give different results in your 3D printer due to different nozzle width and printer settings.

### X rail mounts

The X rail mounts are designed to be screwed directly onto Igus slider blocks. Also they hold at the bottom the GT2 belt clamp mechanism. Igus rails were chosen for the Y-axis as a 6mm wide GT2 belt fits perfectly between rails and slider block.
